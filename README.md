Flatiron School launched Community Powered Bootcamp in November of 2016 with the goal of creating a curated community of students who are passionate about learning and growing together. Over the last four years we have appreciated the chance to be a part of your learning journey. As we continue to evaluate the best ways to serve our students, we have come to the decision that Community Powered Bootcamp will no longer be part of the Flatiron School program offerings. 

Effective March 31, 2021 Flatiron School will no longer offer Community Powered Bootcamp. 
This means that we will not collect any additional payments beyond February 28, 2021, and access to this curriculum will be turned off on March 31, 2021.
